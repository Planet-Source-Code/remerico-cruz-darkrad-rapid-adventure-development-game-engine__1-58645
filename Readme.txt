[Introduction]
This is the first unstable release of the DarkRAD Editor and Engine. This should be used for testing purposes only. Please pass this program, including this note, to other people who want to participate in tracking down bugs and giving suggestions for this program.


<[-----------------------------------------------------------------]>

[What the heck is this?]

For starters, DarkRAD lets you create your own graphical adventure game by using the Editor (DarkEditor.exe), and you can play your adventure game by using the engine (DarkEngine.exe).

There is not much you can do with it right now, and in case you didn't read the paragraph above, this version of this program is for testing purposes only. Don't expect to create a real cool full-blown professional adventure game yet, but if you do encounter bugs or you wanted to give feedback / comments / suggestions / criticism / food / money / clothing / anything, please do send them in. Scroll down to the contact page for more info.


The Editor is composed of 7 parts, namely:

  [Game Settings] - You can setup your game here, pick options, whatever
  [Resource Editor] - This is where you store all your stuff that you need for your game, the pictures, music, you name it.
  [Room Editor] - You edit the rooms (or worlds) in your game here, where your player will move about.
  [Dialog Editor] - You can control the flow of your game herre. In other words, the programming starts HERE. Don't panic. Programming using a language called "DIALOG" is very easy, I assure you.
  [Item Editor] - Create the inventories that your player will use in your game here. Not completely functional yet.
  [Character Editor] - Edit your character here (not done yet)
  [Appearance Editor] - Edit the appearance of your game GUI in here, using an (almost) easy-to-use object-oriented visual basic-like integrated development environment (whew!) Not completely functional yet, but it looks cool so far...

<[-----------------------------------------------------------------]>

[Sampol Game]
Included in the zip file is a sample game (sampol.adv) that you can play by running DarkEngine.exe, to demonstrate what DarkRAD can do as of now. The game is far from completed. You are also free to take a look and edit the game, by using DarkEdit.exe

<[-----------------------------------------------------------------]>


[Bugs/Limitations/Outstanding issues]

  - Many features are still missing in this version, but don't worry, these features will be included in the future versions
  - No save game yet (So there's no load game yet)
  - Inventory cannot be used
  - You can only play MIDI files as of now
  - "Advanced options" on the room editor are not yet working
  - The dialog editor isn't very tolerant to syntax errors...
  - Some bugs in the editor - don't do a lot of weird stuff.. it might blow up :p
  - I'm hungry.

[Notes]

I have tried very hard to make this alpha release as bug-free as possible, but there still might be some bugs that I do not know about. I deeply apologize for any bugs that might have caused you inconvenience.

  - Please backup your game regularly. This is an unstable release, so there might be some bugs that could corrupt hours of hard work on your game.

  - This might sound silly, but for your own safety, you might want to backup essential files on your computer before running this program. I do not want to freak you out, but this program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. I shall not be held responsible if your monitor explodes in front of you because of running this program.
